# multitool++

## Cross-platform multitool written in C++

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- C++ Compiler (if you won't use a precompiled binary)
- Linux or Windows system (you may be able to run the software on macOS via WINE)

### Using a compiler
You will first have to download the source code. We recommend using a GitHub release for stability.

It's as simple as compiling `main.cpp`. For example, if you are on Windows and using G++:

```sh
g++ -o main.exe main.cpp
```

### Using the precompiled binaries
You can easily download and run a precompiled binary from the releases.

## IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT

As of this being wrote, our Windows binary is currently detected by multiple antivirus engines on VirusTotal. If you have the time, please report this as a false positive! The program is **NOT** malware.

## FAQ

**Q**: It's detected as malware by Antivirus!  
**A**: Antivirus engines will probably flag files that barely do anything.

**Q**: Will there be a native macOS binary?  
**A**: Too complicated to implement.
