## Installation

### Prerequisites
C++ Compiler (if you won't use a precompiled binary)

Linux or Windows system (you may be able to run the software on MacOS via WINE)

### Using a compiler
You will first have to download the source code. We recommend using a GitHub release for stability.

It's as simple as compiling main.cpp. For example if you are on Windows and are using G++:
```powershell
g++ -o main.exe main.cpp
```
### Using the precompiled binaries
You can easily download and run a precompiled binary from the releases.

## Source Code
The software is fully open source and copylefted under the [GNU GPL v3.0](./LICENSE).
